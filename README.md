## About
This is one of my first attempts on using Unity, while making a game. It's a very simple one level platformer game. My goal was to focus on practising C# while learning Unity, instead of applying complicated animations and gameplays.
## Deployment
You can access the game [Link to the game](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/my-first-game-with-unity-2?fbclid=IwAR2Ewy3tFV9AQx0-UvxsMPkZ_PASuMhTC7JXLF_GWxQnRZZOF2z-d2-Jp6s) and feel free to play arround and provide any feedback about code quality or anything else. <br>
It's still have some bugs and isn't polished, hope to improve it in the future, as well as, present more complicated projects of my own :).
